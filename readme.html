This is the readme for the XPP model associated with the paper:

Lindskog M, Kim M, Wikstrom MA, Blackwell KT, Kotaleski JH (2006)
Transient calcium and dopamine increase PKA activity and DARPP-32
phosphorylation. PLoS Comput Biol 2:e119

This model contains corrections for several typos that appeared in the paper.
Please see the top of the code for details.

Model usage:

Start XPP with the model with a command like
xppaut DARPPmodel_2006.ode

Run the model by clicking on
Initialconds -> (G)o

After the model is done running you can create the panels of Fig 5A-F by
plotting the variables "PKAc", "p34", "PP1", "ratio", "p75" and 2*"PKAr".

To plot Fig 5A, for example, click on
Graphic Stuff -> (E)dit curve
then press Enter on the keyboard
Replace the Y-Axis: field with the value PKAc
click OK
Click on 
Window/Zoom -> (F)it

then you will have a graph that looks like:
